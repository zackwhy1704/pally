## Small-screen geometry audit (2026-07-21) — follow-ups from Phase A

### ⚠️ LIVE: dio 5.10.0 breaks compilation on a fresh `pub get`
- **What:** `pubspec.yaml` allows `dio: ^5.7.0` and `pubspec.lock` is **gitignored**, so a
  fresh `flutter pub get` (CI, a new machine, a clean checkout) resolves **dio 5.10.0**, whose
  new `DioExceptionType.transformTimeout` is not handled by the enum switches in
  `lib/core/error/pally_error.dart` and `lib/app/api_client.dart` → **the whole app fails to
  compile** (an existing test, `exam_prep_screen_test.dart`, also fails to build). Local dirs
  survive only on a stale-locked 5.9.2.
- **Why deferred (from the layout branch):** dependency/error-handling, NOT layout — kept out of
  `fix/small-screen-invariants`. But this is a **pre-submission blocker** (any clean CI build breaks).
- **Closes it:** its OWN tiny branch — either cap `dio: ">=5.7.0 <5.10.0"` in `pubspec.yaml`, or add
  the `transformTimeout` case (and a `default`) to both switches, then restore `^5.7.0`. Do this SOON.

### Onboarding CTAs below the fold at 360×640 (CONFIRMED, tests written + skipped)
- **What:** `direct_onboarding` (steps 1-2) and `onboarding` (pages 1-3) render their primary CTA
  ("Next"/"Create account"/"Let's go →") below the 640-fold — reachable only by scrolling. Confirmed
  by `test/geometry/cta_invariant_test.dart` (the 5 tests are committed, `skip:`-ed with a DEFERRED ref).
- **Why deferred:** the fix is pattern (1) (pin the CTA: `Column[Expanded(scroll), pinnedCTA]`), but it
  restructures two AUTH-FLOW screens (`direct_onboarding_screen` is 1500+ lines) and deserves careful,
  unhurried work + its own verification — not end-of-session bracket surgery. Stays strictly layout-only.
- **Closes it:** pin each page/step CTA out of the scroll; un-skip the 5 CTA tests (they gate it green).

### settings_screen — ListTile without a Material ancestor
- **What:** a `ListTile` sits in a coloured `DecoratedBox` with no `Material` between (×2) →
  "background/ink may be invisible" assertion. Surfaced + EXCLUDED (with reason) in the smoke registry.
- **Why deferred:** a render-hierarchy fix (wrap in `Material`), not one of the 2 geometry patterns.
- **Closes it:** add the `Material` ancestor; re-enroll `settings_screen` in the smoke registry.

### subscription_return_screen — provider mutated during build
- **What:** `initState` → `_poll()` → `ref.read(entitlementVmProvider.notifier).refresh()` mutates a
  provider during first build ("Tried to modify a provider while the widget tree was building").
  Surfaced + EXCLUDED (with reason) in the smoke registry.
- **Why deferred:** a LOGIC/state fix (defer the poll to a post-frame callback), NOT layout — out of the
  branch's scope rule ("a fix that can't stay layout-only → STOP + report").
- **Closes it:** move the initial `_poll()` to `WidgetsBinding.addPostFrameCallback`; re-enroll the screen.

## Avatar Hub (shipped 2026-07-14) — follow-ups

### Home avatar cards through the hub
- **What:** Home's `_AvatarCard` (`home_screen.dart`) taps DIRECTLY to `ModuleListRoute`;
  the Library rows now go through the per-avatar Hub. For consistency, Home should route
  through the hub too — one front door everywhere.
- **Why deferred:** Home is NOT just a different tap target — its card is a grid tile with
  its OWN concepts the hub doesn't model: `isActive` slot-lock (`_showSlotLockedSheet`) and
  a long-press tutor-options menu (`_showTutorOptions`). Folding those into the hub is its
  own design pass, and it doubles the diff of a de-clutter that shipped clean on Library alone.
- **Closes it:** a dedicated Phase 0 for the hub absorbing slot-lock + long-press semantics,
  then re-point `_AvatarCard.onTap` (active branch) to `AvatarHubRoute`.

### Hub v2 — absorb the remaining avatar-scoped surfaces
- **What:** study-plan, brain-health, exam-prep, homework are avatar-scoped routes that sit
  OUTSIDE the current journey (Learn → Practice → Prove → Tools). Should the hub become the
  single index for them too?
- **Why deferred:** v1's job was to make the CORE journey legible; bolting on four more rows
  would recreate the clutter we just removed, one level down. It's a product-IA decision, not
  a mechanical add.
- **Closes it:** decide the v2 information architecture (a "More" section? a second tab? leave
  them on their own entry points?) with the real screens in front of you, then wire the chosen
  shape — reusing the `_HubSection` / `_HubRow` grammar already in `avatar_hub_screen.dart`.

### Hub small-device density (fast-follow, belt-and-suspenders)
- **What:** the hero's "N modules · X% mastery" + progress bar is now the densest line in the
  app. The suite pins no-overflow at 320dp / 1.3× textScale, but a real SE-class-width visual
  pass at 1.3× on the hero is worth a manual glance.
- **Closes it:** run the hub on an SE-width device at 1.3× accessibility text; confirm the hero
  line wraps (never clips). Non-blocking — the guard test already asserts `takeException()==null`.
