## Avatar Hub (shipped 2026-07-14) — follow-ups

### Home avatar cards through the hub
- **What:** Home's `_AvatarCard` (`home_screen.dart`) taps DIRECTLY to `ModuleListRoute`;
  the Library rows now go through the per-avatar Hub. For consistency, Home should route
  through the hub too — one front door everywhere.
- **Why deferred:** Home is NOT just a different tap target — its card is a grid tile with
  its OWN concepts the hub doesn't model: `isActive` slot-lock (`_showSlotLockedSheet`) and
  a long-press tutor-options menu (`_showTutorOptions`). Folding those into the hub is its
  own design pass, and it doubles the diff of a de-clutter that shipped clean on Library alone.
- **Closes it:** a dedicated Phase 0 for the hub absorbing slot-lock + long-press semantics,
  then re-point `_AvatarCard.onTap` (active branch) to `AvatarHubRoute`.

### Hub v2 — absorb the remaining avatar-scoped surfaces
- **What:** study-plan, brain-health, exam-prep, homework are avatar-scoped routes that sit
  OUTSIDE the current journey (Learn → Practice → Prove → Tools). Should the hub become the
  single index for them too?
- **Why deferred:** v1's job was to make the CORE journey legible; bolting on four more rows
  would recreate the clutter we just removed, one level down. It's a product-IA decision, not
  a mechanical add.
- **Closes it:** decide the v2 information architecture (a "More" section? a second tab? leave
  them on their own entry points?) with the real screens in front of you, then wire the chosen
  shape — reusing the `_HubSection` / `_HubRow` grammar already in `avatar_hub_screen.dart`.

### Hub small-device density (fast-follow, belt-and-suspenders)
- **What:** the hero's "N modules · X% mastery" + progress bar is now the densest line in the
  app. The suite pins no-overflow at 320dp / 1.3× textScale, but a real SE-class-width visual
  pass at 1.3× on the hero is worth a manual glance.
- **Closes it:** run the hub on an SE-width device at 1.3× accessibility text; confirm the hero
  line wraps (never clips). Non-blocking — the guard test already asserts `takeException()==null`.
